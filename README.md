Webprofiler
=======================

This module provides functions to collect various data from query logs and the
Xhprof extension and a UI to view performance related data within Backdrop.

This module is not a direct port of the Webprofiler module for Drupal because it
depends on some Symfony components. Instead it is an attempt to recreate the
features in a way that is more integrated with Backdrop.

I have also taken some code and inspiration from the Devel module as well as a
project called Xhgui.
